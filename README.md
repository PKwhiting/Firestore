# Overview

My current webpage is my first attempt at using a cloud databases for data mangament for a simple website. I am utilizing Firebase Firestore. The software I am trying to create is just a basic login and register functionality. Registering creates a new document within the user collection and ideally, logging in would query the database and verify that the username and password of a user logging in exists and is valid. The username and password are displayed after logging in or registering. Following registering or logging in, you can delete your account or update your account information. Currently I am running the frontend and backend of the JS all in one file. I would like to create full websites using node.js as the backend and using firebase as my database. Its ease of use and ability to write and read data fairly easy makes it an attractive database to use for my personal project.
